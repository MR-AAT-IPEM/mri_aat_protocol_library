# Philips Ingenia Ambition R11.1

These example **MRI AAT** sequences are form a Philips Ingenia Ambition X 1.5 T system on software R11.1. These example sequences are taken from common protocols in clinical use within a NHS Trust and are provided as both examples of sequence parameters using AAT and, where appropriate, for use on compatible systems.

Currently sequences from the following anatomical regions are included:
- Head
- Upper limb
- Lower limb

In some cases complete protocols may be provided through this resource, but in general only those sequences with AAT applied are provided.  

Only Philips ExamCard files are provided, for direct upload onto compatible MR systems

Note: Many Philips systems are currently on software release R11 (as of September 2023). We are aware of possible issues with the import of the provided diffusion sequence in the brain onto systems with R11.   

**Disclaimer:** *these protocols are in routine clinical use, but we provide no assurance regarding suitability for clinical use in your institution. All sequences should be reviewed and approved locally prior to clinical use and we recommend an ongoing review process and assessment of image quality in a broad range of patients prior to local approval to use routinely.*

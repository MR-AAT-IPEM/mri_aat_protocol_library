# SIGNA Premier 3.0T Wide bore

These example **MRI AAT** sequences are from a SIGNA Premier 3.0T Wide bore scanner, software version: MR30.0_R01_2242.a, Gradient Coil Type: HRMW, Gradient Amp Type: RGD Gradients.

These example sequences are taken from common protocols in clinical use within an NHS Trust and are provided as both examples of sequence parameters using AAT and, where appropriate, for use on compatible systems.

Currently the following anatomical regions are included:
-	Knee
-	Ankle
-	Foot
-	Hand
-	Wrist 
-	Shoulder
-	Prostate (Standard)
-	Prostate (DCE)

Complete protocols are provided. For sequences with AAT applied look out for HyperSense (Compressed Sensing) and HyperBand Slice (simultaneous multi-slice acquisitions) under the Acceleration tab. For AIR Recon DL (deep learning reconstruction) see Recon DL Strength options: Off, Low, Medium, or High under the Details tab. 

Sequence parameters are not provided in the PDFs which only give high level summary information. Copying the content of the folder ‘SIGNA Premier’ onto an external storage (blank USB or CD) and loading onto the scanner will upload the complete protocol(s). Information on how to use the Protocol Exchange tool on the scanner is provided in PDF form.

**Disclaimer:** *these protocols are in routine clinical use, but we provide no assurance regarding suitability for clinical use in your institution. All sequences should be reviewed and approved locally prior to clinical use and we recommend an ongoing review process and assessment of image quality in a broad range of patients prior to local approval to use routinely.*

# Description

These example sequences are taken from common protocols in clinical use within a NHS Trust and are provided as both examples of sequence parameters using AAT and, where appropriate, for use on compatible systems.
 
Currently the following anatomical regions are included:
- Head and neck
- Spine
- Upper limb
- Lower limb
 
Note that in some cases complete protocols are provided, but in general only those sequences with AAT applied are provided.
 
Both the .exar protocol file (for import onto compatible systems) and pdfs of protocol parameters are provided.
 
Sequences are form a Siemens Sola on software XA51 with XQ gradients.
 
Deep Resolve Boost vs Deep Resolve Gain: note that in some cases Deep Resolve Gain is being used instead of Deep Resolve Boost â€“ this may for technical/artefact reasons or it may be that the protocol was optimised prior to Deep Resolve Boost being available on the system.
 
**Disclaimer:** *these protocols are in routine clinical use, but we provide no assurance regarding suitability for clinical use in your institution.  All sequences should be reviewed and approved locally prior to clinical use and we recommend an ongoing review process and assessment of image quality in a broad range of patients prior to local approval to use routinely.*

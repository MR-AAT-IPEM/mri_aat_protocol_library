# The MRI AAT Protocol Library

Welcome to the [MRI AAT Protocol Library](https://github.com/MR-AAT-IPEM/mri_aat_protocol_libray/tree/main) provide by the **IPEM MR AAT T&F Group** (Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine Magnetic Resonance Advanced Acceleration Technology Task & Finish Group). 
The information presented below reflects clinical user experiences shared through the IPEM AAT T&F Group. 
Members of the IPEM MR AAT T&F Group receive no funding from scanner manufacturers and have no conflicts of interest to declare.

## What is MRI AAT
MRI AAT refers to a group of techniques used to accelerate MR image acquisition (i.e. Compressed Sensing (CS), Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)). 
For further information on MRI AAT you can check out:
- [The IPEM MR AAT T&F Group Webinars](https://www.ipem.ac.uk/resources/other-resources/webinars/advanced-acceleration-technology-in-mri-an-overview/)
- [The IPEM User Experience Resource](https://www.ipem.ac.uk/resources/mr-advanced-acceleration-technology/) 
 
## How to use
- The direcotories in the [MRI AAT Protocol Library](https://github.com/MR-AAT-IPEM/mri_aat_protocol_libray/tree/main) contain example clinical protocols which demonstrate the implementation of AAT.
- Directories are arranged by **manufacturer name**, **scanner model** and **software version** so that relevant protocols can be easily found
- Each directory contains a README.md describing the contents in more detail

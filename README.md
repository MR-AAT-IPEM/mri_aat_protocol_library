# The MRI AAT Protocol Library
Welcome to the [MRI AAT Protocol Library](https://github.com/MR-AAT-IPEM/mri_aat_protocol_library) provide by the **IPEM MR AAT T&F Group** (*Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine Magnetic Resonance Advanced Acceleration Technology Task & Finish Group*).


The information presented below reflects clinical user experiences shared through the **IPEM AAT T&F Group**. Members of the **IPEM MR AAT T&F Group** receive no funding from scanner manufacturers and have no conflicts of interest to declare.

## What is MRI AAT?
**MRI AAT** (MRI Advanced Acceleration Technology) refers to a group of techniques used to accelerate MR image acquisition. These are:  
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS)
- Compressed Sensing (CS)


For further information on **MRI AAT** check out:
- [The IPEM MR AAT T&F Group Webinars](https://www.ipem.ac.uk/resources/other-resources/webinars/advanced-acceleration-technology-in-mri-an-overview/)
- [The IPEM User Experience Resource](https://www.ipem.ac.uk/resources/mr-advanced-acceleration-technology/) 
 
## How to use
- The direcotories in the [MRI AAT Protocol Library](https://github.com/MR-AAT-IPEM/mri_aat_protocol_library) contain example clinical protocols which demonstrate the implementation of **MRI AAT**.
- Directories are arranged by **manufacturer name**, **scanner model** and **software version** so relevant protocols can be easily found.
- Each directory contains a **README.md** describing the contents in more detail.
